Setting up Minix OS:
1. Open Linux Terminal and type "setup vmware" followed by "minix-get-image" followed by "vmware &" to setup the Minix Environment (Note: This will erase any previous images of Minix)
2. In your Minix Environment use default username root and set a secure password (So when you use ftp it prompts you for it)
3. In your Minix OS type "tcpd ftp /usr/bin/in.ftpd &" to setup the ftp command for the Linux Terminal
4. Use "ifconfig" in Minix to get your IP to use ftp on and then ftp with that IP in Unix terminal to gain remote access to the Minix Environment
5. In Minix cd all the way back to the root and cd /usr/src to get to the necessary file
6. Type "make world" and run to test compliation of the files

Changing the Copyright in the Minix OS Bootup:
1. In your terminal (before ftp), set the directory to the locaiton you want the file to copy to
2. Then use ftp to enter the Minix Environment and directed yourself to the /urc/src/kernel file location
3. When here use the get functioin to copy over the main.c file ("get main.c main.c")
4. This will copy the main.c file from the minix environment to your Linux machine
5. Open this file and scroll down to the Copyright print statement and change it to a different phrase and save the file
6. Go back to the Minix OS in the VM and use the rm function on main.c to remove it ("rm main.c")
7. Go back to the Linux Minix environment and use the put function to copy the Linux main.c to the kernel folder in the Minix ("put main.c main.c")
8. Go into the Minix OS in the VM and "ls" to check if the main.c file transfered properly
9. "cd .." and run "make world" to compile the new main.c
10. After the make world is done running, run reboot and you will see your change where the copyright line used to be
