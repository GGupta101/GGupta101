# Description: This is the answers to the questions asked in the lab instructions and other observations

Step 1: Transfered the fork code into an editor

Step 2: Compiled the code sucessfully

Step 3: Ran the excecutible file and got a "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" error

Step 4: Ran the program with the command line arguement of 3000 and it ran with that delay. When testing the 500 arguement, it ran way faster than the 3000 arguement. The 5000 arugement ran slower than the 3000 arguement.

Step 5: Created a recurrsive function that takes in a level and an n (delay) and can create 7 threads with the forkRecurrsive(6,n); call

Step 6: In the main we create 2 threads which each all the start routine and then merge/join back to the main thread. At the end it sasya main thread done

Step 7: Simple fork program that only has one parent and one child where the child runs ls and the parent waits for the child to finish
