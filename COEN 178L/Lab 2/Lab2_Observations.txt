Title: COEN 178 Lab2 Observations


PART 1 QUESTIONS:
a) Did you successfully insert all the tuples?
---I was able to insert all of the tuples except the ('dg5','c32','t') tuple into the schedule table as the c32 custid does not exist in the customer table.

b) Did you successfully insert ('dsg','c2','s') into the schedule table?
-- I was not able to add this tuple into the table as the check in the deliveryservice table for day limits the delivery days to weekdays only.

PART 2 QUESTIONS:
e) It will not work so we have to fix it. Fix it implemented in the lab2_queries1.sql file.
f) The names are coming from the customer table while the scheduled deliveries are coming from the schedule table.
i) It will not work so we have to fix it. Fix it implemented in the lab2_queries1.sql file.
