PART 1 QUESTIONS:
Do you see the message, Table created, at SQL prompt?
---Yes, the table was created.
Do you see all the tuples you have entered in the table?
---Yes, I see the one tuple of (1, 'A test')
Did you succeed in adding a duplicate tuple?
---Yes, I have two tuples with the data of (1, 'A test')
Did you succeed in adding a duplicate row?
---No, Primary Key means that there can only be one str per tnum therefore we get the "unique constraint" error when we try to insert the second time
Do you see the tables (trial and test) that you have created so far?
---Yes, I can see TRIAL and TEST
What do you see?
---After dropping the TRIAL table I only see the TEST table when I SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM USER_TABLES;

PART 2 QUESTIONS:
---Was able to use a sql script to insert into the table

PART 3 QUESTIONS:
How many rows are retrieved from the table?
---Staff_2010 has 453 rows
