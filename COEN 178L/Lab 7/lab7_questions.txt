Title: COEN 178 Lab7 Questions

Questions:
1.1) Do a Select * on the views you have created in a and b. Do they work?
---Both the views work.
1.2) What was inserted for budget, startdate and enddate? 
---All three values were inputed as NULL.
1.3) Insert the following data. Did it succeed? If not, give reasons.
---This did not succeed as we can add to current projects but we can't add to past projects.
1.4) Try to insert the following data. Did it succeed? If not, why not?
---This did not succeed as we "cannot modify more than one base table through a join view".
4.1) Did you succeed? What did you see?
---The trigger was made however the insert did not work because itemorder would be mutating which 
may cause the trigger to miss it. I saw the mutating error in the console.
5.1) Why do you think the prerequisites are in a separate table and not included in the Course table? 
---One course can have multiple prereq's but not vice versa. If the prereq's were in the table the 
relationship would have to be defined pointing to itself which isn't great
5.2) Did you successfully add the above row into the table?
---No the row above could not be added to the limittest trigger throwing the error of 
only 2 prereqs pre course.
5.3) Using Select, check the data in Course_PreReq table. How many rows are there?
---2 rows.
5.4) Using Select, check the data in Course_PreReq table. How many rows are there?
---After the valid insert there are 3 rows.
5.5) What is the result of update above? Did it work? Did you see any mutating table error?
---The update did not work because course_prereq would be mutating which 
may cause the trigger to miss it. I saw the mutating error in the console.
6.1) Do a select and display the data in Course_Prereq. Is the constraint, a course cannot have more 
than 2 prerequsites, enforced?
---Yes the constraint is enforced.
6.2) Do an update as shown. What is the result? 
---The update is stopped as the constraint, a course cannot have more than 2 prerequsites, is enforced.
6.3) Is the constraint, a course cannot have more than 2 prerequsites, enforced?
---Yes the constraint is enforced.
